Files in this directory should not be modified or removed. They are used by
system tests, such as serf_url_async_fetcher_test, which expects them to be
specific golden sizes and contents.

Make sure httpd.conf has this:

    <Directory "/var/www/html/do_not_modify/cgi" >
      Options +ExecCGI
    </Directory>
    AddHandler cgi-script .cgi
