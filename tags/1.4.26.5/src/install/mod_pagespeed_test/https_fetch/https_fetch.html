    This image should be proxy-mapped to localhost:PORT/mod_pagespeed_dot_com/...
    and optimized fully by the local server.  The fact that modpagespeed.com is
    running mod_pagespeed is not relevant in this example.  We are only hitting
    modpagespeed.com because it is set up with a reasonable self-signed cert and
    that works using the default https port 443.

<!--
    This image URL will be rewritten on modpagespeed.com assuming that it runs the
    same current configuration as localhost.  This is only sensible because
    modpagespeed.com is running mod_pagespeed.
