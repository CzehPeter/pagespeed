Updating BoringSSL can sometimes be tricky!

Because sometimes the gypi file can change drastically upstream, we will
have to take the gypi file from chromium's trunk and modify the paths.

The gypi can be found here
https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git/+/master/third_party/boringssl/
(master, but choose the proper revision to match the version of boringssl
we are upgrading to).

The following `sed` commands can be used to transform the chromium gypi to a
usable format for us.

sed -i 's/src\//<(openssl_root)\//g' boringssl.gypi
mv boringssl.gypi openssl.gypi

And then take chromium's precreated err_data.c file, and the folders,
linux-x86, linux-x86_64, mac-x86_64, mac-x86, win-x86, win-x86_64,
linux-aarch64, linux-arm, which contain the assembly routines, and place them in
this directory.
