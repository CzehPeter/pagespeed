# Wget is used three different ways.  The first way is nonrecursive and dumps a
# single page (with headers) to standard out.  This is useful for grepping for a
# single expected string that's the result of a first-pass rewrite:
#   wget -q -O --save-headers - $URL | grep -q foo
# "-q" quells wget's noisy output; "-O -" dumps to stdout; grep's -q quells
# its output and uses the return value to indicate whether the string was
# found.  Note that exiting with a nonzero value will immediately kill
# the make run.
#
# Sometimes we want to check for a condition that's not true on the first dump
# of a page, but becomes true after a few seconds as the server's asynchronous
# fetches complete.  For this we use the the fetch_until() function:
#   fetch_until $URL 'grep -c delayed_foo' 1
# In this case we will continuously fetch $URL and pipe the output to
# grep -c (which prints the count of matches); we repeat until the number is 1.
#
# The final way we use wget is in a recursive mode to download all prerequisites
# of a page.  This fetches all resources associated with the page, and thereby
# validates the resources generated by mod_pagespeed:
#   wget -H -p -S -o $WGET_OUTPUT -nd -P $OUTDIR $EXAMPLE_ROOT/$FILE
# Here -H allows wget to cross hosts (e.g. in the case of a sharded domain); -p
# means to fetch all prerequisites; "-S -o $WGET_OUTPUT" saves wget output
# (including server headers) for later analysis; -nd puts all results in one
# directory; -P specifies that directory.  We can then run commands on
# $OUTDIR/$FILE and nuke $OUTDIR when we're done.
# TODO(abliss): some of these will fail on windows where wget escapes saved
# filenames differently.
# TODO(morlovich): This isn't actually true, since we never pass in -r,
#                  so this fetch isn't recursive. Clean this up.
