# Yet Another Attempt (YAA) at robustly stopping Apache.  Fun facts:
#    - graceful-stop not supported in all versions of Apache 2.2+.
#    - graceful-stop complains about pid in pidfile not running but exits 0
#    - Worker MPM child processes take longer to exit than parent.
#
# Usage:
#     stop_apache.sh apachectl_program pid_file httpd_program stop_command port
