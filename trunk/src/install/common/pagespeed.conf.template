    # ModPagespeedUrlPrefix is the prefix assigned to some types of
    # rewritten resources. This directive will be removed in a future
    # release. For now, you must specify a URL and path for a hostname
    # that is served by this Apache
    # instance. http://yourhostname/mod_pagespeed is a good default
    # value (replace localhost, below, with the hostname of your
    # Apache instance).

    # Override the mod_pagespeed 'rewrite level'. The default level
    # "CoreFilters" uses a set of rewrite filters that are generally
    # safe for most web pages. Most sites should not need to change
    # this value and can instead fine-tune the configuration using the
    # ModPagespeedDisableFilters and ModPagespeedEnableFilters
    # directives, below. Valid values for ModPagespeedRewriteLevel are
    # PassThrough and CoreFilters.
    #
    # ModPagespeedRewriteLevel CoreFilters

    # Explicitly disables specific filters. This is useful in
    # conjuction with ModPagespeedRewriteLevel. For instance, if one
    # of the filters in the CoreFilters needs to be disabled for a
    # site, that filter can be added to
    # ModPagespeedDisableFilters. This directive contains a
    # comma-separated list of filter names, and can be repeated.
    #
    # ModPagespeedDisableFilters rewrite_javascript

    # Explicitly enables specific filters. This is useful in
    # conjuction with ModPagespeedRewriteLevel. For instance, filters
    # not included in the CoreFilters may be enabled using this
    # directive. This directive contains a comma-separated list of
    # filter names, and can be repeated.

    # ModPagespeedDomain
    # authorizes rewriting of JS, CSS, and Image files found in this
    # domain. By default only resources with the same origin as the
    # HTML file are rewritten. For example:
    #
    #   ModPagespeedDomain cdn.myhost.com
    #
    # This will allow resources found on http://cdn.myhost.com to be
    # rewritten in addition to those in the same domain as the HTML.
    #
    # Wildcards (* and ?) are allowed in the domain specification. Be
    # careful when using them as if you rewrite domains that do not
    # send you traffic, then the site receiving the traffic will not
    # know how to serve the rewritten content.

    # Enables server-side instrumentation and statistics.  If this rewriter is
    # enabled, then each rewritten HTML page will have instrumentation javacript
    # added that sends latency beacons to /mod_pagespeed_beacon.  These
    # statistics can be accessed at /mod_pagespeed_statistics.  You must also
    # enable the mod_pagespeed_statistics and mod_pagespeed_beacon handlers
    # below.
    #
    # ModPagespeedEnableFilters add_instrumentation


    # This handles the client-side instrumentation callbacks which are injected
    # by the add_instrumentation filter.
    # You can use a different location by adding the ModPagespeedBeaconUrl
    # directive; see the documentation on add_instrumentation.

        # file, to allow any client that can reach your server to examine
