// This class is a utility for filters that combine multiple resource
// files into one. It provides two major pieces of functionality to help out:
// 1) It keeps a ResourceVector and provides methods to keep track
//    of resources and URLs that can be safely combined together while
//    encoding the information on the pieces in the combined URL.
// 2) It implements Fetch, reconstructing combinations as needed.

  // by 36 chars. So 100 seemed like a nice round number to allow two
  // filters to run after this and then for there still be a little slack.
