apr_memcache2.c started out as an almost-exact clone of apr_memcache.c
from the Apache HTTPD distribution.  It was initially checked in with
only some (char*) casts to avoid const-errors in the blaze build.

It has been modified to poll server-connections prior to reading to
reduce the possibility of freezing Apache if memcached is wedged.
