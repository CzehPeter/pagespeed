Description
Modified and trimmed version of rdestl

Local Modifications:

hash_map.h has been copied to rdestl_hash_map.h with 3 modifications:
  1. References to rdp::pair has been replaced by std::pair as that
     class is exposed at the interface.

  2. Tabs & trailing whitespace were removed and the file re-indented by Emacs.

  3. dos2unix to remove trailing CRs.

The original hash_map.h is included verbatim.

Unused .cpp and .h files that duplicate STL functionality have been removed.
