# and memcached is then shut down.
#
# Due to limitations in the author's bash skills, this script is run in
# one of two modes:
#    .../run_program_with_memcached.sh -multi command one \; command two \; ...
# or
#    .../run_program_with_memcached.sh any one command allowing "quoted args"
#
# The latter is used for running unit tests, potentially with a quoted argument
# like  --gtest_filter="AprMemCache*".  The former is used for running system
# tests twice: one with cold-cache and once with warm-cache.
