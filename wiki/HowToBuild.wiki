#summary How to build mod_pagespeed from source

== Prerequisites ==
The build has been tested on Ubuntu Hardy/Lucid and CentOS 5.4. It should work elsewhere; if you try it somewhere new, please leave a comment with your success or failure.

We require Apache (>= 2.2), g++ (>= 4.1), Python (>= 2.6), subversion, and make.
  * On Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install apache2 subversion g++ make devscripts fakeroot python`
  * On CentOS: `sudo yum install httpd subversion gcc-c++ make rpm-build python`

To build on CentOS 5.4, you must install Python 2.6.  You don't need to replace the system-provided Python 2.4 -- you just need to have "which python" point to python 2.6.  For example:

{{{
wget http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/5/i386/epel-release-5-4.noarch.rpm
sudo rpm -ivh epel-release-5-4.noarch.rpm
cd ~/bin  (or somewhere in your path)
ln -s /usr/bin/python26 python
}}}

== Chromium depot tools ==
We require the Chromium 'depot_tools', which are used to build multiple open-source projects with dependencies on other open-source projects.
{{{
  mkdir -p ~/bin
  cd ~/bin
  svn co http://src.chromium.org/svn/trunk/tools/depot_tools
}}}
You will need to add the depot_tools to your path. i.e. in bash:
{{{
  export PATH=$PATH:~/bin/depot_tools
}}}

== Checking out mod_pagespeed and dependencies ==
{{{
  mkdir ~/mod_pagespeed    # any directory is fine
  cd ~/mod_pagespeed
}}}
Either latest stable version:
{{{
  gclient config http://modpagespeed.googlecode.com/svn/branches/latest-beta/src
  gclient sync --force     # this will download all source code
}}}
or the bleeding edge version
{{{
  gclient config http://modpagespeed.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/src
  gclient sync --force     # this will download all source code
}}}

== Running unit tests ==
{{{
  cd ~/mod_pagespeed/src
  make BUILDTYPE=Release mod_pagespeed_test pagespeed_automatic_test
  ./out/Release/mod_pagespeed_test
  ./out/Release/pagespeed_automatic_test
}}}
If you get any errors while running tests, report a bug or send us an email at mod-pagespeed-discuss@googlegroups.com.

== Compiling mod_pagespeed ==
{{{
  cd ~/mod_pagespeed/src
  make BUILDTYPE=Release   # BUILDTYPE defaults to 'Debug'
}}}
To see the actual g++ commands, you can type `make V=1`.

TODO: describe advanced compilation options such as compiling against system headers.

== Installing mod_pagespeed ==

For RPM/DEB platforms, you can use the packaging instructions in the "Building mod_pagespeed RPM/DEB packages" section below. For other platforms you can use the custom installer documented here:

{{{
  cd install
}}}

If you built and installed the Apache web server from source (as opposed to installing using a deb/rpm package manager), you can use the `install_apxs.sh` script:

{{{
  ./install_apxs.sh
}}}

The script will infer the proper installation locations for your system, based on information gathered from the Apache apxs tool. These defaults can be overridden on the command line by specifying environment variables. See the contents of the `install_apxs.sh` script for specific details on these environment variables. If you installed Apache in a non-default location, you may need to tell the script where to find the apxs tool, like so:

{{{
  # Specify the path to your apxs binary
  APXS_BIN=/usr/local/exampleapache/bin/apxs ./install_apxs.sh
}}}

Alternatively, if you already know all of the installation details for your system, then you can run the [http://code.google.com/p/modpagespeed/source/browse/trunk/src/install/Makefile Makefile] with custom parameters for:
{{{
  APACHE_ROOT=/etc/httpd
  APACHE_MODULES=/etc/httpd/modules
  APACHE_CONTROL_PROGRAM=/etc/init.d/httpd
  APACHE_USER=www-data
  APACHE_DOC_ROOT=/var/www/html
  ... # see makefile for more options
}}}

Run:
{{{
  make APACHE_ROOT=...  ... staging
  sudo make ... install  # Use make ... -n install to see the commands without executing
  sudo make ... stop start  # Restart your apache server
}}}

For the common configurations of Ubuntu and CentOS, we have included simple installer wrappers ubuntu.sh and centos.sh for your convenience. You can use these as examples to build scripts for your custom environment and then run them as:

{{{
  ./foo.sh staging
  sudo ./foo.sh install
  sudo ./foo.sh stop start
}}}

== Updating to a new version ==
You can repeat the install process at any time to re-install mod_pagespeed.

To update to the latest version, first configure to the latest tag, eg:
{{{
  gclient config http://modpagespeed.googlecode.com/svn/branches/latest-beta/src
}}}
Then sync your client:
{{{
  gclient sync --force
}}}

Now you can re-build and install using the instructions above.

== Building mod_pagespeed RPM/DEB packages ==

You can build packages using the following commands:
{{{
  make BUILDTYPE=Release linux_package_rpm
}}}
or
{{{
  make BUILDTYPE=Release linux_package_deb
}}}

The resulting package file will be in the `out/Release` directory.

== Monitoring a mod_pagespeed installation ==
You can view a simple set of real-time variables by visiting `http://localhost/mod_pagespeed_statistics`.  By default, this page is only viewable from localhost; you can enable additional hosts in `pagespeed.conf`.
