# This script might help cleanup any leftover resources that prevent
# Apache from restarting.  The error message might look a little something
# like this:
#
# [Sat Oct 16 21:22:46 2010] [warn] pid file /usr/local/apache2/logs/httpd.pid
# overwritten -- Unclean shutdown of previous Apache run?
#
# [Sat Oct 16 21:22:46 2010] [emerg] (28)No space left on device: Couldn't
# create accept lock (/usr/local/apache2/logs/accept.lock.16025) (5)
#
#   ./apache_cleanup $USER
#
# You may want to see the owners of the IPC blocks by running ipcs -s
# manually.  For example, you might need to run:
#
#   sudo ./apache_cleanup www-data
# or
#   sudo ./apache_cleanup root
