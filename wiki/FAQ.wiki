= When will you support my favorite OS/http server/protocol/ice cream flavor? =
While we have no dates to announce for upcoming releases, we definitely want to know what you think we should be working on.  Please click on the "Issues" tab, and search for your feature.  (If you don't find it, open a new issue and tag it "Type-Enhancement"). Then click on the Star icon in the top left of the Issue page.  That way, we'll know how many people are interested, and you'll get any updates we post about that feature.

= I installed mod_instaweb; why isn't it rewriting any of my pages? =

  # Check the HTTP response headers from your page (e.g., run `curl -D - http://example.com`).  Look for a header like `X-Mod-Pagespeed: 0.9.0.0-215`.  If you don't see one, this means that Apache is not adding `mod_pagespeed` to the filter chain, meaning the problem is probably in your Apache `.conf` files. One possible cause for this is multiple references to {{{SetOutputFilter}}}: only one of those will win.  See http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/core.html#addoutputfilterbytype
  # It's possible that none of the active mod_pagepspeed rewriters found anything useful to rewrite in your page.  Try enabling more aggressive ones!
  # mod_pagespeed cannot optimize resources (css, js, or images) that are marked as cache-control:nocache or cache-control:private. If your default caching headers are marked as such, mod-pagespeed will not rewrite the resources.

= I am using !WordPress and my log is filled with errors and my pages are blank =

Disable compression in the !WordPress plugin, so that mod_pagespeed will process uncompressed HTML.  mod_pagespeed automatically adds mod_deflate to the filter after running, so the optimized HTML will be compressed before serving.

= I installed Apache 2.2 with ... but mod_pagespeed rpm says "httpd >= 2.2 is needed" =

In order to use mod_pagespeed packages (.rpm, .deb) from the [http://code.google.com/speed/page-speed/download.html download site] you must have installed Apache httpd from a package manager. If you compiled them from source (for example, using cPanel/!EasyApache) then you cannot use the packages. Instead you need to install from source using the instructions at HowToBuild.

= mod_pagespeed broke my site; what do I do? =

First of all, sorry about that. We put a lot of work into validating our rewrites against a large corpus of websites and disable filters that cause problems as soon as we can, but sometimes things slip through.

Second, please upgrade to the latest version, we are continually working on bug-fixes and turning off filters that break pages.

If it's still breaking your site, please post a bug at http://code.google.com/p/modpagespeed/issues/list . If you can, the following information will make it much easier to diagnose:

  # Try appending {{{?ModPagespeed=off}}} to the URL. This de-activates mod_pagespeed module. If the site is still broken, it is not a rewrite or HTML parsing problem. It might be a configuration clash, please ask us at mod-pagespeed-discuss@googlegroups.com or file a bug.
  # If that fixed the site, try appending {{{?ModPagespeed=on&ModPagespeedFilters=}}} to the URL. This turns on mod_pagespeed, but no filters. If the site is broken now, it is an HTML parsing problem. Please let us know.
  # If the site still worked, try appending {{{?ModPagespeed=on&ModPagespeedFilters=foo}}} for various filters "foo". For example try:
{{{
http://www.modpagespeed.com/?ModPagespeed=on&ModPagespeedFilters=extend_cache
http://www.modpagespeed.com/?ModPagespeed=on&ModPagespeedFilters=combine_css
http://www.modpagespeed.com/?ModPagespeed=on&ModPagespeedFilters=inline_css
http://www.modpagespeed.com/?ModPagespeed=on&ModPagespeedFilters=inline_javascript
http://www.modpagespeed.com/?ModPagespeed=on&ModPagespeedFilters=insert_img_dimensions
http://www.modpagespeed.com/?ModPagespeed=on&ModPagespeedFilters=rewrite_images
http://www.modpagespeed.com/?ModPagespeed=on&ModPagespeedFilters=rewrite_css
http://www.modpagespeed.com/?ModPagespeed=on&ModPagespeedFilters=rewrite_javascript
}}}
You may have to reload them a few times over several seconds to make sure they have had time to load sub-resources into cache and rewrite them. If one of these breaks your site, you now know which filter is at fault. Please [http://code.google.com/p/modpagespeed/issues/list post a bug] to let us know. You can disable that filter by adding a line to your pagespeed.conf file:
{{{
   ModPagespeedDisableFilters foo
}}}
