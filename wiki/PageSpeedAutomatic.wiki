#summary The HTML optimization technology used in mod_pagespeed

= Introduction =

mod_pagespeed is an Apache HTTPD module that rewrites web pages according to best practices to improve latency and reduce bandwidth.  Most of the underlying technology is not dependent on Apache or HTTPD, but is designed to be applicable to any Web Server, or to use in another custom application such as a static web-site rewriter.  This technology is called Page Speed Automatic.

Page Speed Automatic is a set of C++ classes that define the rewriting infrastructure.
