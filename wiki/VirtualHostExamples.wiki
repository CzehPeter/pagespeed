#summary Examples of using mod_pagespeed on VirtualHosts

By default mod_pagespeed installs itself for the entire Apache server including all [http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/vhosts/ VirtualHost]s. If you want the exact same configuration for all !VirtualHosts than you can just use the default configuration layout.

This pages covers some examples of mixed installations on multi-server setups.
